# Crime and Socioeconomic Deprivation Analysis in Cardiff and Swansea

This project investigates the relationship between crime rates and socioeconomic deprivation (income and employment) in Cardiff and Swansea using spatial analysis techniques in QGIS.

## 🧭 Objective
To identify patterns and correlations between crime hotspots and areas with high economic and employment deprivation, helping inform targeted urban policy interventions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- QGIS
- R
- Shapefiles (.shp, .dbf, .prj, etc.)
- Spatial analysis (overlay, buffer)
- Socioeconomic datasets

## 📂 Project Files
- **QGIS project file:** `30121974.qgz`
- **R script:** `30121974.R`
- **Crime Buffers:** Files for Cardiff and Swansea (shapefiles)
- **Documentation:** `30121974.docx`

## 📊 Methodology
1. Imported shapefiles of Cardiff and Swansea crime data.
2. Performed buffer and overlay analysis to identify crime clusters.
3. Cross-referenced spatial data with socioeconomic metrics (income & employment domains).
4. Visualized results in QGIS.
5. Analyzed patterns using R.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Areas with higher unemployment and lower income scores tend to have higher crime density.
- The findings support using spatially targeted policy and resource allocation.

## 📌 Usage
Clone or download this repository, then open `30121974.qgz` in QGIS to explore the spatial layers. Use the R script for statistical analysis.
